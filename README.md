# classparty

Classparty.net is a entry in the ACS #flattenthecurvehack by the team Hacklings


We have designed a virtual classroom linked to ‘Google Classroom’. This is a more interactive and beneficial version. It includes features that help children feel as if they were at school. The website is linked in to ‘Google Classroom’ so other children or teachers in the class can still use the old version.

Augmented Reality - Using the students webcam to generate an bitmoji style character and shares with the class, so no student video is transferred to the server. (Teachers can use augmented bitmojis, or real video feed). Classmates can see other students bitmojis talking in the classroom and walk around playground and have breakout conversations (like a game).

Virtual Reality - Students can wear google cardboard to see their teacher in their living room, and go on excursions with live presenters, where they can see classmates bitmojis walking along side them and ask questions to the facilitator of the excursion location (farms, museums etc)

Safe WebCam use with school children


This website asks you to enable your webcam, however unlikely other video conference software the webcam is processed on the students computer and only sends the facial landmarks to the ClassParty server. These facial landmarks can be used with third party emoji/bitmoji characters to communicate with their teacher and classmates during virtual classrooms and in the AR and VR experiences.

Child safety and security issues associated with mainstream video conference software has been in the news alot in the last few weeks, and our solution offers an alternate to transmitting videos of childrens faces.

If you enabled your webcam, you can preview this functionality at the top of this feed. In production, you would be able to see your teacher and classmates 'faces'.
